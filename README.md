# Application name
This protocol implements the task of distributing arbitrary graph states over quantum networks of arbitrary topology. The goal is to distribute this states in a way that is most efficient in terms of the number of Bell pairs consumed and the number of operations realized by the protocol. 
Assumptions:
1) Perfect distribution of Bell pairs occurring at perfectly synchronized times.
2) Perfect node local computation.
3) Ignore the cost of classical communications.
4) Ignore processing time of local quantum processor.
5) Ignore the cost of quantum memory.
